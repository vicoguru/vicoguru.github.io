This is where you would but a short bio, and/or a description of your site. It also serves as an example of how to set up a standalone page. For example:

My name is Vico, I am 15 years old and in the 10th grade. I am interested in computers and robotics. I got into programming a few years ago and I started developing for android about a year ago. I found it very interesting but it was difficult at time to learn about it due to the fact that there was little documentation on how to code in android. Many of the websites that try to explain it to you assume that you already have experience in programming and although I had some it was not always enough to understand everything that I was being told. I decided to make this site so that people my age without previous experience in programming would be able to learn android and possibly other languages later on.
