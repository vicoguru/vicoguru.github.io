## Vico

My name is Vico, I am a 15 years old high-school student. I am interested in math, computers and robotics. From time to time, just to blow off steam, I play some on-line games, most notably DotA. 

I got into programming a few years ago and I started developing for mobile devices about an year ago. I found it very interesting, but it was difficult at time to learn due to the fact that there was little documentation that caters to the people my age. Many of the websites that try to explain it, assume that you already have experience in programming and although I had some, it wasn't always enough to understand everything I read. 

I decided to make this site so that people my age, with little or no previous experience in programming, would be able to start from the very basic and progress to the most advanced. 

## Guru

While the term Guru comes from Sanskrit term for "teacher" or "master", in today's conversations the word has more of a meaning of an "expert". While I am by no means an expert yet, I would like to think of my self more of an  "imparter of knowledge".

While progressing with my explanations I will probably omit stuff, make mistakes or not make myself clear. I will be welcoming your positive feedback in the comments section of each post.

Thanks for reading and happy trails!
